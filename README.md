# Enigma

Enigma is a Java program that recreates the famous Enigma machine used during World War II, as well as other variations of the Enigma machine. This simulator provides a hands-on experience for users to understand and experiment with the encryption and decryption processes of this historical cryptographic device.

## Enigma Machine Basics
The Enigma machine consists of a series of rotors, a plugboard, and a reflector. When a letter is entered, it goes through a series of transformations as it passes through the rotors and plugboard, making it incredibly difficult to decipher without knowing the initial settings.

**Rotors:** Rotors are circular disks with a series of electrical connections. Each rotor has a different wiring configuration. When a letter is pressed, the rotor turns, changing the electrical connections and therefore the letter's encryption.

**Plugboard:** The plugboard allows for additional letter swaps before and after entering the rotors. It further increases the complexity of the encryption.

**Reflector:** The reflector sends the electrical signal back through the rotors, ensuring that the encryption process is reciprocal (i.e., encrypting and decrypting with the same settings).
